## 📖 Project Overview

The **Chemical Equipment Parameter Visualizer** is a hybrid **Web + Desktop** data analytics application designed to analyze and visualize operational parameters of chemical equipment from CSV datasets.

A **single Django REST backend** powers both platforms:

- 🌐 **Web Dashboard** built using **React**
- 🖥️ **Desktop Application** built using **PyQt5**

The system allows users to upload datasets, compute summary statistics, visualize trends, generate PDF reports, and maintain upload history with user metadata.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Enable structured analysis of chemical equipment data  
- Provide a consistent user experience across web and desktop platforms  
- Demonstrate full-stack development with real-world workflows  
- Showcase data analytics and visualization skills
