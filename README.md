# 🛠️ Setup Instructions

This project contains three components:

- Django Backend API  
- React Web Application  
- PyQt5 Desktop Application  

Follow the instructions below to set up and run each part locally.

---

## 1️. Backend Setup (Django API)

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+  
- pip  

### Steps

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adhityae-506/FOSSEE-Chemical-Equipment-Visualizer.git
cd FOSSEE-Chemical-Equipment-Visualizer
```
#### 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
#### 3. Activate the environment
##### Windows
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
##### macOS / Linux
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
#### 4. Install backend dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
#### 5. Apply migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
#### 6. Run backend server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
##### API will be available at
https:127.0.0.1:8000/api/

## 2️. Web Application Setup (React Frontend)

### Requirements
- Node.js v18+
- npm

### Steps

#### 1. Navigate to frontend folder
```bash
cd frontend
```
#### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
#### 3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```
##### Web app will run at:
https://localhost:5173

#### Configure API Base URL
Inside frontend/src/api/api.js
```js
const API_BASE = "https://127.0.0.1:8000";
```

## 3️. Desktop Application Setup (PyQt5)
### Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- PyQt5 

### Steps

#### 1. Navigate to desktop app directory
```bash
cd desktop_app
```
#### 2. Run the application
```bash
python main.py
```
##### A GUI window will open
###### IMPORTANT: Make sure the backend server is running before starting the desktop app.

## 4. Using the Application (Web + Desktop)
### Upload CSV File

Upload a .csv file with columns: 
- equipment_name
- type  
- flowrate 
- pressure 
- temperature

## 5. Desktop App EXE
The packaged EXE is available at:
```bash
desktop_app/dist/
```


## 📂 Test Data — Sample CSV (Required for Testing)

This project includes a sample dataset required to test all features of the **Web** and **Desktop** applications.

### Location
```bash
sample_equipment_data.csv
```

This CSV file contains chemical equipment data and is used to test:

- Uploading datasets  
- Summary API  
- Charts (bar + pie)  
- Recent upload history  
- PDF report generation  
- Desktop app upload workflow  

📌 **Evaluators can use this CSV while testing the project.**  
Upload it through either interface (React Web App or PyQt5 Desktop App) to validate the entire pipeline.



📊 PDF Report Includes  
- Title & metadata  
- Summary statistics table  
- Equipment type pie chart  
- Page 2 → First 30 rows of CSV  
- Clean and professional styling  

💻 Desktop App (EXE) Usage  
- Download the executable from /desktop_app/dist  
- Double-click to open  
- Upload CSV → View Summary → View Charts → Download Report  

🌐 Web App Usage  
- Open → https://symphonious-truffle-440ed5.netlify.app/  
- Click Upload CSV  
- View summary + charts  
- Download the PDF report  
- Check History to see last 5 datasets  

🛠 Technologies Used
